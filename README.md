# WebService-Project
My Senior year Last project and it was about developing an API about a chosen topic.
My topic was university so i decide to make a flask app that allows the user to filter search through a number of universities by different measures such as state , specialty , degree.
The app also has user functionalities like login logout and authorization and authentication methods.
I have also added a webpage that i developped using HTML/CSS/JS to simulate some of the CRUD methods that i implemented.
The aim of my app is to facilitate the choice of prospective universities to student who just graduated high school plus some other helpful tools to measure their performance in national examinations.
